~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   PLAN FOR THE GAME JAM  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    --->  GENERAL POINTS  <----

        .how do we want to integrate the theme?
            IDEAS:
                ~ gravity changes
                ~ two player (take turns with shots)
                ~ for on edge maybe in the sky and when you fall down the bottom it goes back to the top
            FINAL CHOICE:
                ~ 

        .

    ----> POTENTIAL MODULES <-----
    
        -> START SCREEN <-
            . Cool design that shows off the theme
            . seperate while loop that we can continually run, when start is pressed we break the while loop and start the rest of the game.
            . pixel art or vectors?
            . should we overlay buttons or make it more dynamic (eg we could have if you hover over the start it expands in size)
            . start game, help, about us, etc.

        -> MAPS <-
            . make a function that gets the input of each map and turns it into a bunch of rects.
            . put rects into list depending on the type of material (eg. water, brick, sand, etc.)
            . also need to figure out something for if it hits the side of a rect or the top. 

        -> BALL PHSYICS <-
            . need to figure out
