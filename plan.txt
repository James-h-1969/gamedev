~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   PLAN FOR THE GAME JAM  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    --->  GENERAL POINTS  <----

        .how do we want to integrate the theme?
            IDEAS:
                ~ gravity changes
                ~ two player (take turns with shots)
                ~ for on edge maybe in the sky and when you fall down the bottom it goes back to the top
            FINAL CHOICE:
                ~ GRAVITY

        .

    ---> EACH PERSON TO DO <-----

        stinky pete:
            -> map rects
        pedro's daughter:
            -> map visuals
        @vikram.vish:
            -> Start screen
        yung nabel:
            -> End screen
        King Hoc: 
            -> BALL stuff
    
    ----> POTENTIAL MODULES <-----
    
        -> START SCREEN <-
            . Cool design that shows off the theme
            . seperate while loop that we can continually run, when start is pressed we break the while loop and start the rest of the game.
            . pixel art or vectors?
            . should we overlay buttons or make it more dynamic (eg we could have if you hover over the start it expands in size)
            . start game, help, about us, etc.

        -> MAPS <-
            . make a function that gets the input of each map and turns it into a bunch of rects.
            . put rects into list depending on the type of material (eg. water, brick, sand, etc.)
            . also need to figure out something for if it hits the side of a rect or the top. 

        -> BALL PHSYICS <-
            . need to figure out for changing the gravity how that is going to work



    ---->  GIT STUFF  <-----

        .setup
        git clone https....     <- this puts all the files in the repository in the folder you want, and means you can change STUFF
        
        .before use
        git pull                <- this puts any change that any else has made from github to your files   
        
        .use
        git add .                     <- this signals what you want to update. Easiest thing is to put . and it will update everything
        git commit -m added_stuff     <- every so often, commit your changes with a message of what you have done so people know
        git push                      <- do this at the end of a session to put all your changes on github.

if gets a collision, checks whether it is top, side or bottom
